[Podcasty](https://podcasty.app) is an app to listen to your favorite podcasts. Podcasty relies on Spotify API to retrive and play the relevant podcasting files. 

## History

Podcasty was formerly based on another podcasting API that ran into issues with image and file sourcing. In the process custom media player was ripped out in exchange for a Spotify based one. It does not require you to sign into your spotify account.
